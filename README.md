# webcrawling_with_python

I am trying to become proficient at modern data-wrangling methods and have spent some time learning SQL and python lately. In order to practice and learn more, I decided to try to develop a project that finds housing costs around the Bay Area from the internet. I wanted to write in python and interact with a SQL database. Currently, I am running a microsoft SQL server instance using Docker. Ultimately I hope to plot the data on a map.
